# interpreter

Contains my implementation of the _Monkey_ programming language interpreter, as detailed in **Thorsten Ball's** book, "Writing a Go Interpreter".

## Features

* **Lexer**: Turns source code into a stream of tokens. ✅
* **Parser**: Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens. ✅
* **REPL**: An interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for the Monkey language. (In progress!)
* **AST Evaluation**: Walk the AST and evaluate parsed expressions and statements. (Comming soon!)
